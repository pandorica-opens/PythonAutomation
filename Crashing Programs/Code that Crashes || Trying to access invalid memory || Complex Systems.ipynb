    "\n",
    "- **accessing invalid memory** means that the process tried to access a portion of the system's memory that wasn't assigned to it\n",
    "    - programming errors might lead to a process trying to read or write to a memory address outside of the valid range \n",
    "        - OS will raise an error like **segmentation fault** or **general protection fault**\n",
    "        - typically happens with low level languages: C or C++\n",
    "            - **pointers** - variables that store memory addresses in those languages - can point to invalid memory; if **0x0** - signal for the end of the structure (never a valid pointer)\n",
    "            - **Example of segmentation fault or segfault**: forget to initialize the variable, access list variable outside of list range, etc. -> **debugger** is the easiest way to pinpoint the problem! -> to do that, the programm needs to be **compiled with debugging symbols** -> same for fucntions if the error occurs in function -> **.PDB** in microsoft compilers\n",
