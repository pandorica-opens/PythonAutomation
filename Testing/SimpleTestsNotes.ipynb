    "  \n",
    "  - test cases; automatic tests - codified into its own software\n",
    "  \n",
    "    - #### unit tests: \n",
    "    \n",
    "    very low level, close to the source of your application; can be testing individual methods and functions of the classes, components or modules used by your software. quite cheap to automate and can be run very quickly by a continuous integration server.\n",
    "    just testing the code in question (small isolated parts of programm is correct) -> isolation! any sucess or failure does not rely on external factors (no test or fail for extrnal reasons!)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - #### integration tests: \n",
    "    \n",
    "    verify that different modules or services used by your application work well together\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - #### functional tests: \n",
    "    \n",
    "    only verify the output of an action and do not check the intermediate states of the system when performing that action.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - end-to-end, acceptance, performance\n"
